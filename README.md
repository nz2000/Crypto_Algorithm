This repository contains the python code for cryptographic algorithms such as: 'Caesar Cipher', 'Vernam Cipher', 'Hill Cipher', 'Rail Fence Cipher' and 'Vigenere Cipher'.
It can both encrypt as well as decrypt any data inputted within it.

This code is still being developed and further optimized, however as of the moment it can solve all the above mentioned ciphers
